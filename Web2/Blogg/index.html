                    <p>
                      One of the first steps on the road to building a skincare
                      routine is determining your skin type. Different skin
                      types have varying needs that need to be met by skincare
                      products. Oily skin types may be more concerned with
                      mattifying ingredients, as opposed to dry skin types that
                      need thick and rich moisturizers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One easy way to determine your skin type is to observe
                      your skin throughout the day. Is your skin shiny and oily
                      by lunchtime, or dry and flakey in the morning? Whatever
                      the case, these characteristics are indicative of your
                      skin type. As dermatologists, we classify skin into four
                      main types:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-of-content">
                      <li>
                        <b>Oily skin:</b> Skin that looks shiny due to an
                        overproduction of oil.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Dry skin:</b> Skin with dry and flakey areas that may
                        feel tight.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Sensitive skin:</b>Sensitive skin: Skin with red and

                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Combination skin:</b> Skin that has a combination of
                        oily and flakey areas.

                    <p>
                      Following the same skin care routine year-round may 
                      not work so well when the humidity drops. Without a change in your skin care, 
                      dry air can make fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable. 
                      Dry, itchy skin can flake, crack, and even bleed.<br/>To help heal dry 
                      skin and prevent its return, dermatologists recommend the following.
                    </p>
                    <p>Stop baths and showers from worsening dry skin.
                       When the humidity drops or your skin feels dry, be sure to:
                       <ul class=list-of-content>
                         <li>Close the bathroom door.</li>
                         <li>Use warm rather than hot water.</li>
                         <li>Limit your time in the shower or bath to 5 or 10 minutes</li>
                         <li>Wash with a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser.</li>
                         <li>Apply enough cleanser to remove dirt and oil, avoid using so much that you see a thick lather.</li>
                         <li>Blot your skin gently dry with a towel.</li>
                         <li>Slather on the moisturizer immediately after drying your skin.</li>
                       </ul>
                    </p>Apply moisturizer immediately after washing. 
                    Ointments, creams, and lotions (moisturizers) work by 
                    trapping existing moisture in your skin. 
                    To trap this much-needed moisture, you need to apply a 
                    moisturizer within few minutes of:
